cotg attack incomings on discord chat

you need to add your discord webhook link in the space provided in the script.
you can add ID's of players in the Discordmembers object to tag them.

This script works when the script is running in the game at all times and stops sending incoming attacks tag's when you turn off the game, this is one of the biggest drawbacks of this script. Only one person in alliance should run the script, restarting the game sends all the incoming attack tag's again to discord.

Any changes in incoming attack makes the script read all incomings and sends any new incomings to discord chat.
